When considering a small number of flips, having a few consecutive heads or tails is probably within the realm of normal probability, but persistent and extreme outcomes such as getting heads 100 times in a row could lead me to start doubting the fairness of the coin. However, I cannot imagine an exact number of times it needs to be flipped for me to begin my doubt, only a rough estimate.

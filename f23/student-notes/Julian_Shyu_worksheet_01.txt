Flipping 10 coins with all heads implies a chance of (0.5)^10 or 0.1% odds, flipping it 30 times (total, so 20 more times) and getting all heads will mean that it is a 0.0000001% chance. Which is statistically possible, but at that point I would stop because there's no way this coin is still getting heads after being less than a 1 in a million odds. Also considering the fact that I spent the last couple minutes flipping one coin 20 times.

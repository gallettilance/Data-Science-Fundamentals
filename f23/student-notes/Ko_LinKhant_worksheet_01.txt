It would depend on you personally sometimes but we can use our knowledge of probability to use here to determine if it makes sense to us. 

For example: 
If we consider this as a fair die, 
    To get 5 consecutive rolls, the probability will be (1/2)^5 = 0.03125

Now, let's assume it is not memoryless, 
    To get 10 consecutive rolls together, 
    the probability will now be (1/2)^10 = 0.00097

This is even less than 0.01%. So, I personally would not believe my friend anymore after the second 5 consecutive rolls. 
The probability is significantly low.

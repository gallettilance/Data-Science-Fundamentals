A fair coin means that it is independent of one another regardless of past or future events. I flipped the coin 5 times and got heads, which is .5^5 meaning it is 3.25%. A very low probability. I did another 5 times and got heads, meaning I got .5^10 which is 0.09765%. So, this is a very unlikely chance, but it is still possible to get 10 heads in a row. In order to determine fairness, I would flip it a 100 times and count the standard devitation using the formula square root(n)/2 n=sum of heads+tails (with heads=0, tails=1). An unbiased coin would have a SD of 5 with n being around 40 and 60. As long as in 100 coin tosses, there are around 40 to 60 heads and 60 to 40 tails (or reversed) than I would be not suspicious.

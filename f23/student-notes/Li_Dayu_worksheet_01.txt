A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.

After seeing 5 consecutive Heads twice in a row, I already began to have doubts. 
The probability of getting all Heads in five consecutive flips is approximately 3%, 
and the probability of getting it ten times in a row is about one in a thousand. 
In this case, I find it hard to believe that I have such good luck unless there is 
an issue with the fairness of the coin.

### Topics

- Git

## Prerequisites (installations)

#### This is your checklist:

- [x] Access to terminal
- [x] Install Git
- [x] Sign up for a GitHub account
- [x] Choose editor
- [x] Set up ssh keys
- [x] Configure git

### Step 1: Work Environment:  Access to Terminal

- Mac/Linux: use **Terminal**
- Windows:
	- Option 1:  [Power Shell](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/simple-questions-what-powershell-what-can-you-do-it)
	- Option 2:  Git Bash (recommended)

### Step 2: Install Git

- Mac:  
	- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- Windows:  
	- [Git for Windows (Git Bash)](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Linux:
	- [Install Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)

Confirm Git is installed by typing `git --version` on your terminal

### Step 3: Sign up for a GitHub Account

 Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)

### Step 4: Choose a Graphical Editor

- Try Visual Studio Code
	* [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- OR one of these other editors
	* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
	* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (for Windows)

### Step 5: SSH Setup

#### Mac & Linux Users

Go to home directory (in terminal)

```bash
% cd ~
% pwd
/Users/gallettilance
```

Go to `.ssh` directory

```bash
% pwd
/Users/gallettilance
% cd .ssh
% pwd
/Users/gallettilance/.ssh
```

**Note:**  If you do not have the `.ssh` directory, you can create it

- if you are in your home directory:
	- <kbd> mkdir .ssh </kbd>  
- if you are not in your home directory:
	- <kbd> mkdir ~/.ssh </kbd>  

Generate `id_rsa` keypair files if needed

- **Note:**  these `id_rsa` files contain a special password for your computer to be connect to network services (Ex:  GitHub, AWS).
- Check to see if these files exist by typing <kbd> ls -alt</kbd>
- If you do not have these two files (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`), create them by typing:  
	- <kbd> ssh-keygen</kbd>
	- Hit  <kbd> enter  </kbd> **3 times**

```bash
% pwd
/Users/gallettilance/.ssh
% ls
% ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/gallettilance/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/gallettilance/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/gallettilance/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jmDJes1qOzDi8KynXLGQ098JMSRnbIyt0w7vSgEsr2E gallettilance@RESHAMAs-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|   .=+           |
|.  .==           |
|.o  +o           |
|..+= oo          |
|.E.+X.  S        |
|+o=o=*oo.        |
|++.*o.+o.        |
|..*.oo           |
|o= o+o           |
+----[SHA256]-----+
% ls
total 16
-rw-------  1   1675 Dec 17 12:20 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1    422 Dec 17 12:20 id_rsa.pub
%
```

Navigate to the `.ssh` directory

<kbd> cd ~/.ssh </kbd>  

open `id_rsa.pub` using your editor of choice and copy its contents. Add `ssh` key to GitHub by following these steps:

- go to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/) (create one if you don't have one, and save your user name and password somewhere easily accessible for you.)
- click on your avatar/profile picture (upper right of screen)
- go to `Settings`
- on left of screen, select `SSH and GPG keys`
- Select <kbd> New SSH key </kbd>
- for "Title":  entitle it  "GitHub key"
- for "Key":  paste key from clipboard here
- click <kbd> Add SSH key </kbd>
- save, exit, confirm GitHub password as requested

#### Windows Users

Follow [How to Create SSH Keys with PuTTY on Windows](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/create-with-putty/)

#### For Windows 10 or 11
- Press Windows+R
- Enter cmd
- In the opened Command Prompt, type in “ssh-keygen”
- Press Enter
- You can choose to enter a passphrase, it will not be displayed.
- Go to the shown path to find your file named id_rsa.pub Ex. C:\Users\user/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub
- Open the file with a notepad and copy everything
- Go to github and click settings at top right
- Go to SSH and GPG keys, click New SSH key and paste your SSH key here.
- Click Add SSH key. You might be asked to enter Github password.
- Go back to your Command Prompt and type in “ssh -T git@github.com”
- Enter your SSH passphrase.

- You will see “You’ve successfully authenticated” in the following message. Which means you are now connected to Github.

### Step 6: Configure Git



#### Configure user name and email (lets Git know who you are)

<kbd> git config --global user.name "First Last"  </kbd>  
<kbd> git config --global user.email "myname@email.com"  </kbd>  

To verify these additions, type:  
<kbd> git config --list  </kbd>  

#### Default Editor

The default editor will be [Vim](https://vim.rtorr.com/). You may want to look up how to edit, save, and close vim as this can't be done with just point and click (you must use the vim commands).

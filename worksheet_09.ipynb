Each point within cluster 0 agrees with every other point regarding their cluster membership in both C and P. Therefore, the number of agreements can be calculated using the combination formula: (3 * 2 / 2) = 3 agreements. Employing the same approach for the other clusters, we find 1 pair and 6 pairs respectively. Consequently, the total agreements amount to 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

This involves creating two lists or arrays, (C[i]) and (P[i]), where (i) represents the index of a point in (D), and the values represent the cluster number to which point (i) is assigned in (C) and (P) respectively.\n",

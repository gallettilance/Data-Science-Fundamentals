A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

The more consecutive heads in a row increases doubt as the probability of this would be like (.5)^however many coin flips. At 10 coin flips this is such a low probability that I would doubt the coins fairness.

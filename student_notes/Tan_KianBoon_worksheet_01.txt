The probability of a fair coin landing on heads every time for n times can be modeled as (1/2) ** n, i.e. half to the power of n.Once this probability gets low enough, the fairness of the coin can start to be questioned. How low of a probability to accept is subjective, but I would personally go for a probability of 0.01.Hence, to calculate the number of times the coin would have to land on heads, we can solve for n in the equation (1/2) ** n <= 0.01, which results in n being 7.

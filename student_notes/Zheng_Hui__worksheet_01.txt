Question: A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.
Answer: First of all, getting 10 heads out of 10 flips with a fair coin is possible. If you only have the single coin. It's pretty subjective to determin when to start doubting, because there's no threshold that you can rely on. Personally, I would start doubting the fairness of the coin after the second trial, because the possibility is about 0.1%.

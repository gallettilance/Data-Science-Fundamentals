A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit

The first five times would have been enough for me to doubt the fairness of the coin. This is because the question itself seems like a geometric distribution since you are doing trials until you get a success. In a fair coin, the expectation of heads would have been two (since the probability of getting tails in a fair coin in 1/2 and the geometric distribution says that the expectation is 1 over p). Finally, since the expectation isn't always going to occur, I will say that first five times would be a safe bet on doubting the fairness of the coin since the probability of getting 5 heads in a row is quite low  (since   (1/2)^5 = 1/32 = .0315) )

A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

When I flipped 10 times and it lands on Heads every single time, I will doubt the fairness of the coin since the possibility of continually landing on Heads or Tails 10 times is only 1/1024. So I will doubt the fairness since the possibility is so small.

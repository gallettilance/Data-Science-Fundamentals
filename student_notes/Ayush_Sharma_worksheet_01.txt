If this happens repeatedly, say 2 or 3 times, it becomes quite reasonable to doubt the fairness of the coin because the probability of 10 heads in a row is 0.0009765625 which is very unlikely to happen in practical real life scenarios. But afterall it's all about probability and we can never determine for sure if the coin is unfair because the probability will never go to 0, it will tend to 0 when we consider infinite heads in a row. But to determine the fairness, I believe repeating this process 2-3 times is enough.

A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

Answer: 
For a fair coin to land heads 5 times in a row, that would equate to 0.5^5 = ~3% so I would be doubtful. If the next 5 is also all heads,
that a probalbity is extremly small so I would seriosly doubt that the coin is fair.

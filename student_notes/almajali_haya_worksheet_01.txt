The probability of getting 10 consecutive heads when flipping the coin is low but not impossible when dealing with a 'fair' coin. However, if a more extreme streak occurs such as 20 consecutive heads, occur, I would then question the fairness of the coin and look at other factors that might be influencing the outcome.

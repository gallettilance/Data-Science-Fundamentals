Upon encountering the question, my mind immediately jumped to Bayes' Theorem. Instead of attempting to solve the problem directly, I chose to apply the underlying philosophy of Bayes' Theorem to this scenario. 

It's a rather subjective matter, and I envisioned myself in the role described in the problem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B)/P(A). In my perception, I initially assume the coin to be fair, setting my prior probability, P(B), at 50%. The question essentially asks at what point, after a certain number of occurrences, I would begin to doubt the coin's fairness. This corresponds to how the accumulation of events over time shifts my subjective perception, ultimately altering the posterior probability. P(A) represents the occurrence of the event, or the evidence. P(A|B) indicates the impact of data generation on my perception, i.e., the likelihood, while P(B|A) is the updated perception I ultimately arrive at, the posterior probability. This is akin to the human learning process, where inherent beliefs are gradually modified with ongoing experiences. While everyone's prior probability might start at 50%, the likelihood assigned by each individual after repeated events would differ. When the course of events strays beyond expectations, it's reflected in the posterior probability. This probability exceeds a certain mental threshold, at which point I would begin to consider the coin unfair.

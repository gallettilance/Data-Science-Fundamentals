<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> main
A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.
Answerï¼š
10 times. The reason is that it significantly deviates from the expected 50-50 distribution of Heads and Tails.

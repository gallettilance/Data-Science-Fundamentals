I don't know. It depends on a series of elements. Has that friend of mine tricked me before? 
Does that coin look suspicious? Does that coin have the same weight as the standard coin? 
Am I able to balance the coin on its edge? 
The reason why I do choose not to just doubt is because no matter how many same consecutive results I've gotten with this coin, it is still statistically possible. Not impossible.

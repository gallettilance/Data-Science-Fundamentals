Question: 
A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must 
this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.

Answer:
The likelihood of a fair coin landing on heads 10 times in a row is 
(1/2)^10 = 0.09765625 %. This is a very low possibllity as it is below 1%. We could have safely started doubting then.
Otherwise we could have also started doubting the coin after the 7th toss since the likelihood of getting heads on 7
consecutive tosses is also below 1%.

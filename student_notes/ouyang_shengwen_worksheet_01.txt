When a coin, claimed to be fair, consistently lands on heads for 10 consecutive flips (5 flips twice), the likelihood of this event under the assumption of fairness is quite low (about 0.0977%). While statistically possible, such an outcome is rare enough to raise doubts about the coin's fairness. In statistics, a p-value less than 5% is often considered significant; here, the outcome's p-value is well below this threshold, suggesting that skepticism is warranted. Human intuition about randomness may lead to suspicion even sooner. Therefore, after observing 10 straight heads, it's reasonable to start questioning the fairness of the coin, as the observed outcome is highly improbable for a fair coin.

It depends on the level of confidence-significance level alpha. The chance of getting 10 heads in a row is ( 10C10 ) * 0.5^10 = 0.0009765625 which is 0.09% which is very low. It might be still possible that the coin is fair since those are independent events and the history is not affecting the current outcome. However, it depends on the level of confidence when we start to doubt the fairness of the coin. Let say 6 throws out of 10: (10C6) 0.5^6 * 0.5^4 = 0.205078125 which is 20.51%

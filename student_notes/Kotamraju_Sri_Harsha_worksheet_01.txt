A fair coin has a 50 percent chance of landing on heads or tails. The probability of getting heads n times in a row is calculated as 0.5 to the power of n.

In this scenario, the coin lands on heads 10 times in a row. The probability of this happening is 0.5 to the power of 10, which is approximately 0.1 percent, which is quite rare. Therefore a person would start doubting the fairness of the coin after 10 flips.

A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time.
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must 
this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.

Ans: Since we had a sequence of 10 consecutive coin flips and all outcomes were heads,
by the concept of independence in probability, each flip was an independent event. 
So, the outcome of one flip does not affect that of the next. The probability of 
getting heads on each flip is 50% = .5. But, even the coin was fair, you can’t assume 
that you would always get that 50% chance not to get another head. In this case,
getting 10 consecutive heads, does not mean we need to start doubting the fairness
of the coin because 10 flips wasn’t a large number enough. We should have tried a
very large number to start thinking that the coin was unfair.

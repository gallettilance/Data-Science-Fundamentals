I think I would give it 5 more tosses (so 10 in total) before I started to question whether or not if the coin was fair. For me, in small tests, I always feel like 10 is a number that is good to work with and I feel like logically in my head, a coin could not flip heads 10 times in a row. I think I would really start to question the legitimacy there.

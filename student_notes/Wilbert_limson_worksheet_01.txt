Since the probability of a fair coind is 0.5 for head and 0.5 tails. In terms of fairness, we have to understand that when you throw a coin 10 times in a row that is (0.5)^10 and it's quite unlikely due to the probability is around 0.001 which is very low, so I will already doubt the fairness of the coin. Therefore by applying binomial test with null hypothesis with the coins is fair with probability of heads 0.5 and we can calcutae the probability of observing the result under the hypothesis. If the p value is less than my significance of 0.05, and reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the coin is not completely fair.

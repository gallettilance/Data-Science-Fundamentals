A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

This happens maybe 30 times before I start doubting the fairness of the coin. I'd assume the coin is fair even if it lands on heads every time for 5 times because the coin has no memory; aka the chance of landing on heads is independent of previous events. However, this becomes suspicious when the coin flips heads more than 30 times because that is when a pattern starts to form.

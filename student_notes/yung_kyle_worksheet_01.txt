It would take around the 6th or 7th flip for me to start questioning the fairness of the coin. The first few times I would be convinced that I just had incredible luck or bad luck. If you were to look at it mathmatically and use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability, flipping a coin 6 times and having it land on heads each time is about a 1% chance. While not improbable, anything less than this would immediately seem shady to me since we would be entering the < 1% territory.

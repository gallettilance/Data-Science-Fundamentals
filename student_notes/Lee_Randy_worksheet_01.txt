The probability of the coin always landing on heads is 0.5 every time, 
independent of each other. Therefore while it is unlikely that it lands on 
heads every single toss for n tosses, it is still a possibility. You could check
and compare the number of trials of consecutive 5 head coin tosses to the theoretical
probability of 0.5^(5). This is in line with the prompt's question, but I would
personally err on the side of doing a large number of single toss trials and 
seeing if the probability of tossing a head/tail was about .5.

In statistics, we often use a 5% threshold (p-value < 0.05) to determine statistical significance. If an event has less than a 5% chance of occurring under a null hypothesis (in this case, the hypothesis that the coin is fair), it suggests that the null hypothesis may not be true.

We can calculate for which number of flips, n, the probability (0.5)^n falls below 0.05.

Based on this calculation, after only 5 consecutive heads, the probability of this happening with a fair coin falls below the 5% threshold, which is typically considered statistically significant. Therefore, if I flip a coin 5 times and it lands on heads every time, it's reasonable to start doubting the fairness of the coin.

A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every 
single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same 
result. How many times must this happen for you to start 
doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a 
bit.

Answer:A large number of coin flips gives more evidence to 
the coin being fair or biased, but it never reach 
certainty.

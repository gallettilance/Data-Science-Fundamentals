Usually the fairness of a coin is a 50% probability of landing on either heads or tails in a single flip, assuming we have an unbiased coin. In this case, flipping the coin 10 times and getting heads every time has a probability of 0.5^10 = 1/1024 (assume with a fair coin). It is a rare event. However, since each flip of coin is an independent event, the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the outcome of the next, so it is uncommon but possible to strike 10 times with 10 heads. For me, to be more certain about the fairness of the coin, I would try a larger number of flips like 100 flips. If I consistently get heads over an extended number of trials, it will raise my suspicion towards the fairness of the coin.

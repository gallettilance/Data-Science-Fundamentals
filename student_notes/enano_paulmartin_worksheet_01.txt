A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.

So flipping a coin 5 times in a row would be HHHHH, and the probability of this happening is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2
which is a low probability to begin with. It would only take one more time for this to happen to 
full doubt the fairness of the coin.

There is a 3% percent chance that we get head five times in a row, although very unlikely, it is still possible, geting 5 straight heads in a row twice has 0.09% chance which is very very unlikely and provide strong proof that its unfair. if we want to approximate the true head probability we could through it 1000+ times and use the probotion as an approximation. However if the sole purpuse of the experinment is tto check if it is fair tthen there is alredy enough evidince that suggest the coin unfairness

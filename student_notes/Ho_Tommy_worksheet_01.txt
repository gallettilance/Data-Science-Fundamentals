A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

The probability that you flip a fair coin and it lands on heads is equal to (1/2) or 50%. If you flip a coin n times the chances that it lands on heads every single time is (1/2)^n. Personally speaking if you flip a coin 10 times and it always lands on heads I would start doubting the fairness of the coin although it is still possible because although the probability of that happening is low (around .097%, less than 1%) there is still a chance that the coin would flip heads 10x in a row, but statistically speaking the chances are really low, so I would personally doubt the fairness.

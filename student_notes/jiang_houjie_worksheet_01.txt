After observing 10 consecutive Heads in coin flips, it may raise suspicion, but it's not enough to definitively doubt the coin's fairness. A fair coin has a 50% chance of landing on Heads, and short-term streaks can occur due to random chance. To assess fairness, more extensive testing is needed, involving hundreds or thousands of flips. If a consistent deviation from the expected 50% is observed over a large sample, it's reasonable to question the coin's fairness. However, a brief streak of 10 Heads should be seen as an anomaly rather than conclusive evidence of bias. Statistical significance requires a more substantial dataset.

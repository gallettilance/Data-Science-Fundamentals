A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.


It is hard to pinpoint the exact number of flips the fairness of the coin is questioned. 
Personally, I would have already began to doubt the fairness of the coin after 10 flips as the probability of that happening is quite low.
The probability of 10 heads in a row is P(10 H in a row) = P(H)**10.
Under the assumption of the coin being fair P(H) = 0.5 for each flip. 
Assuming each flip event is independent, we get P(0.5)**10 = 0.0009765625 or 0.09765625%.
Although flipping ten heads in a row is not necessarily impossible, the probability of that event occuring is extremely low.
This probability will only continue to decrease the more times we flip and continue to only get heads.
After one more time of flipping 5 times and landing on heads every single time, the probability would be P(0.5)**15 = 0.00003051757, or about 
0.00305%.
Thus, I would begin to doubt the fairness of the coin after 10 flips in a row and very much believe the coin is rigged/unfair after 15 flips.

Q:A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.
A:10 times. If a friend presents me with a coin they claim to be fair, and I proceed to flip it 10 times, each time resulting in heads, I would begin to question the fairness of the coin.
From a statistical perspective, the probability of a fair coin landing heads in a single flip is 50%. However, the probability of achieving heads in 10 consecutive flips is exceedingly low, approximately 0.098%. In statistical terms, we typically regard an observed result as potentially significant and start to question the initial hypothesis (in this case, the fairness of the coin) if the probability of such an occurrence is less than 5%.
Therefore, while it is possible that the occurrence of 10 consecutive heads is a random event, the improbability of such an outcome at this magnitude is sufficient to raise doubts about the fairness of the coin. If additional flips continue to result in heads, the grounds for skepticism would be further strengthened.

A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

When running a statistical test, a common significance level is .05, meaning we should start to doubt the null hypothesis when the probability of the event that has occurred is less than .05. The probability of flipping heads for x coin tosses in a row first dips below .05 when x = 5. There is a .03125 chance of this occurring. At this point we may begin to doubt the fact that the coin is fair and there is a .5 chance of flipping heads on every toss. As we continue flipping the coin and still get all heads, the likelihood of the coin being unfair increases.

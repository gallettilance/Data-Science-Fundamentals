A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.


If the coin lands on heads 11 times in a row then I would start doubting the fairness of the coin. The probability of a coin 
landing on heads 11 times in a row is 0.5^11 which is about 0.000488, or once every 2050 times. 
Assuming that the coin flips are independent and there's no external factor influencing the results.
The more consecutive heads observed, the stronger the evidence against the coin being fair, however, such situation do have a slim probability of happening.

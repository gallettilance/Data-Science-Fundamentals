Personally, I would start doubting at 5 and be completely suspicious at 10. Lucky moments and strange incidents do happen, and while 5 of the same thing in a row does happen, it is only around 3% to occur. 10 in a row is naturally even lower, so I would be shocked if it happened 10 times in a row. While 5 is suspicous, I would not start doubting the fairness yet.

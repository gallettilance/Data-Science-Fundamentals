Question: A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

Answer: If this were to happen in real life, I would start doubting the fairness of the coin after 10 more additional times, so a total of 20. Such as rare occurrence to happen in real life truly seems almost impossible. However, mathematically, I know that with each coin toss, because it is fair, there's a 50% chance of each outcome - getting heads or tails. Now, while very rare, with a probability of getting heads 10 times in a row is approximately 0.1% (got from (0.5)^10)), it is important to know that it can still occur. Thus, in order to truly start doubting the fairness of the coin, the sample size must be larger, maybe 100 times, in order to question the fairness That way, we are then able to test the fairness through statistics.

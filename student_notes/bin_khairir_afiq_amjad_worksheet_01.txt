In my opinon, I would start doubting the fairness of the coin if it lands on Heads 10 times in a row. My reasoning of this is through hypothesis testing. Since a coin can only be Heads or Not Heads, and we're tossing it 10 times only, we can consider the trials Bernoulli's trials. My hypothesis would be that if the coin is fair, then p = 1/2. Therefore, for 10 trials, the probability of observing 10 Heads in a row would be (1/2)^10, which is roughly 0.00098%. Since the probability is so miniscule, I will then assume that the coin is therefore not fair, and that it favours Heads when being tossed.

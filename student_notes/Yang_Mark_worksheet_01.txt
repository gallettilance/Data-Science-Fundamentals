A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

A trial of flipping the coin 5 times is sufficent (in showing the coin is perfectly unfair).
On a statistical level, you can take the event assuming a fair coin (5 heads is 1/32) and repeat until the probability decreases below your alpha level. Because we are asking for a fair coin (not if it always lands heads), the probability is doubled as landing all tails is also clearly unfair. Thus you repeat until 2(1/32)^n < alpha. A typical choice of alpha = 0.05 means two trials of 5 coins to be certain.
However, taking into account additioinal bayes factors changes the value in practice. Why did your friend present the coin in the first place? Because of the fact that the question of the coin's fairness was even presented in the first place pushes the bayes factors to favor being unfair. In fact, you could run a psychoanalysis of your friend to refine this further. If you think he is 'mischievous' or 'full of crap' than that gives a bayes factor favoring unfair. The way the said coin is introduced also matters. Did your friend just present the coin or was it picked off the ground in front of you? These thing must be considered to make a decision.
Thus, incorperating both external and interal factors, for an internal confidence of alpha=0.05, choices of 0, 1, 2, 3 are the only reasonale number of 5 trials to be performed. Under reasonable assumptions (a small factor of the question being asked in the first place), one trial is sufficent. 
In addition, if external factors strongly point to being unfair or fair, 0 trials might be sufficent or 3 trials might be required.

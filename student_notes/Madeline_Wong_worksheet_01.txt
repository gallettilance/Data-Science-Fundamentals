After 13 flips (including the initial 10), I would start doubting the fairness of the coin. My reasoning is that if the coin is fair, then the probability of getting heads should be equal to the probability of getting tails, so 0.5 probability each. The distribution of multiple coin flip trials should follow a binomial distribution, which can then be approximated to the normal distribution when there are enough trials. For a normal distribution, 99.7% of data should fall within 3 standard deviations from the expected average value, and for a coin flip, we'd expect half the flips to be heads. For 13 flips and above, for there to be the same number of heads and flips falls outside of this 3 SD range and I would thus doubt the fairness of the coin.

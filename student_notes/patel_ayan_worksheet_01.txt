Since a coin is expected to be heads or tails only 50% of the time, I would expect to get close to 50% head flips and 50% tail flips in the long run. So, while it is unlikely that 10 heads are flipped in a row, it is not a large enough test size to say the coin is unfair. However, in the long run if flipped maybe 100 times and every time is heads, then we may be able to determine that the coin is unfair.

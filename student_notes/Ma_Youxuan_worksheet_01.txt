I would start doubting the fairness of the coin if this happens more than 3 times. And here below is my reasoning:

Given that a fair coin has a 50% chance (probability p = 0.5) of landing on Heads in any given flip, the probability of it landing on Heads 5 times in a row in one trial run of 5 flips can be calculated using:

P(5 Heads in a row) = (0.5)^5.

Because the events (coin flips) are independent, the outcome of one flip does not influence the outcome of the next. Therefore, for 5 flips, the probability calculation is:

P(5 Heads in 5 flips) = (0.5)^5 = 0.03125.

This means there's about a 3.125% chance of flipping a coin and getting Heads 5 times in a row in one set of 5 flips. Seeing this once might seem lucky, but not impossible. However, repeating this success consecutively, say n times, reduces the likelihood dramatically:

P(5 Heads in 5 flips repeated n times) = (0.03125)^n.

After repeating this phenomenon twice (10 heads in a row), which in our case has already occurred, the probability becomes:

P(5 Heads twice) = (0.03125)^2 ≈ 0.0009765625.

This means getting 10 heads in a row has less than a 0.1% chance of occurring. While not impossible, it's improbable enough to start raising suspicions about the fairness of the coin. 

To further illustrate, let’s frame "becoming suspicious" as an event that would occur less than 1 out of 1000 times under conditions of fairness (P<0.001).

Solving for n in the equation P = (0.03125)^n < 0.001, we could use logarithms:

log(P) < log((0.03125)^n)
log(P) < n*log(0.03125)
n > log(P)/log(0.03125)

Plugging in P = 0.001:

n > log(0.001)/log(0.03125) approximates 3.29

Therefore, after seeing this scenario play out 4 times (20 heads in a row), the probability of such an event happening with a fair coin is less than 0.1%, which significantly increases the skepticism regarding the fairness of the coin.

In conclusion, while seeing 5 heads in a row may not immediately warrant suspicion, observing such outcomes consecutively and notably more than three times would make the claim of the coin being fair highly dubious, particularly from a statistical probability perspective.

Question: A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair.
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time.
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting 
the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

Answer: They only need to flip the coin one more time. Since a fair coin has 
an equal probability of 1/2 to be heads or tails I would assume there would 
be at least one flip where a tails appears. I would not waste my time waiting
for a tails to appear if the 11th flip of the coin had another outcome of heads.

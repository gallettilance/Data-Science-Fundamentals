I would definitely toss the coin close to 5 more times until I started to doubt myself regarding whether the coin was fair or not. 10 count tosses, though unlikely they would all be heads, is not a big enough sample space to make a decision. However, after 5 more tosses, if all 15 tosses resulted in heads being tossed, the low probability of such an event would lead me to doubt the fairness of the coin. With 15 coin tosses, each having a Â½ probability of heads, the total probability of 15 heads occurring is (1/2)^15, which is less than 0.01% (essentially 0 percent).  So, at that point, my friend will have most likely been untruthful.

Theoretically this is possible although with an extremely low probability. If I witness a coin turn up heads 10 times in a row, I would have started doubting the coin's fairness by that point. We usually consider a fair coin to have a 50% probability. So typically after 10 tosses we could expect a fair coin to turn up 5 heads and 5 tails. This need not be the case all the time but according to probability calculations, this is what a typical fair coin toss would look like. Getting 10 heads is definitely an improbable event, far from the usual event.

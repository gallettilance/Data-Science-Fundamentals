A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.
With a fair coin, the probability of receiving 10 heads in a row is 0.5^10, or 0.0009765625 or roughly 0.1%. Although unlikely, this possibility still exists. However, the likelihood falls off exponentially as the number of successive heads rises. For instance, the likelihood of receiving 20 heads in a row is 0.5^20, or around 9.54×10^−7, a far smaller chance than in the prior scenario.
When comparing the number of successive heads observed to the predicted likelihood of a fair coin, one may begin to doubt the coin's fairness. Although there isn't a set criterion that is commonly accepted, seeing a lot of consecutive heads—say, 20 or more—could make people doubt the coin's fairness.

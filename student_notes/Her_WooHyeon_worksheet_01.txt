For a fair coin to flip 10 times and land on head every single time is very very unlikely, but it is not impossible.
In decimal, the chance is 0.0009765625. If it was me, I would already started doubting the fairness of the coin. 
If I had luck equivalent to getting head 10 times in a row, I should be buying a lottery instead of flipping a coin.

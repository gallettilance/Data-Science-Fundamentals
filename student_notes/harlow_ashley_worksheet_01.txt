A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit.

Personally, I would be quite shocked after the coin landed on the same side consecutive times, but after 10 would definitely start to accuse my friend of using an unfair coin. There is about a 3% (0.5^5) chance of a coin landing on the same side 5 times in a row, which is a small chance but not entirely impossible. Though it is not entirely impossible for a coin to land on the same side 10 times in a row, there is a less than 0.1% (0.5^10) chance of that happening, which is too small for my liking.

I'm generally pretty doubtful of people showing off coin tricks, so I would doubt the fairness of the coin if I would expect its sequence of Heads to occur less than 5% of the time with a fair coin. A sequence of x heads occurs with probability (0.5)^x on a fair coin. Four Heads in a row has probability 0.0625 and five Heads in a row has probability 0.03125, so a sequence of five heads is the lowest number of heads whose probability dips below my 5% threshold. So, I would start to doubt the fairness of the coin after five heads in a row.

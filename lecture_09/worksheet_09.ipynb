Using the assumption that filtering by cluster is simple, we can quickly gather all points that belong to the same cluster for each method. Once we have these clusters, we count the number of point pairs within each cluster of method P to determine the agreements. To find disagreements, for each point in a cluster in P, we check if it is also paired with any point in the same cluster in C; if not, this counts as a disagreement. The total number of disagreements is then found by subtracting the count of agreements from the total possible pairs in the dataset, which is calculated using the combination formula for the total number of points. This method focuses on reducing the number of operations by using the clusters to guide the comparison process, making it well-suited for large datasets where direct comparison between all points would be impractical.\n",

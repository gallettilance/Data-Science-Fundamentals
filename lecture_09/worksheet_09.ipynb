Each point in cluster 0 agrees with every other point about being in the same cluster in both C and P. Thus, we can calculate the number of agreements using the combination formula: (3 * 2 / 2) = 3 agreements. I can do the same for the other clusters, getting 1 pair and 6 pairs respectively. This leaves a total of 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 agreements. There are 36 potential disagreements, and 10 agreements, leaving 26 total disagreements."

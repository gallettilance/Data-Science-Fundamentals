        "To efficiently compute disagreement distances on large datasets, the initial step involves organizing the dataset into clusters using two different clustering methods, denoted as C and P. Utilizing the assumption that cluster filtering is straightforward, we can swiftly gather all points belonging to the same cluster for each method. Once these clusters are established, we proceed to tally the number of point pairs within each cluster of method P to ascertain agreements. To identify disagreements, we iterate through each point in a cluster in P and verify if it has a corresponding pair in the same cluster in C; if not, it's marked as a disagreement. The total count of disagreements is determined by subtracting the agreement count from the total possible pairs in the dataset, which is computed using the combination formula for the total number of points. This methodology optimizes operations by leveraging clusters to streamline the comparison process, making it particularly well-suited for large datasets where direct pairwise comparison would be unmanageable.\n",

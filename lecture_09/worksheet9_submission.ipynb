Use dictionaries to map each cluster identifier to lists of data points belonging to that cluster. For every cluster defined by P, check the corresponding clusters in C where its points are grouped. If a P cluster's points are distributed across different C clusters, then these constitute potential disagreements. Calculate the number of disagreeing pairs within each of these P clusters using the combination formula, focusing only on pairs that contribute to the disagreement.
